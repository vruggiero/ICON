#  This file prepares the CAMS forecasted aerosols netcdf file for ICON with irad_aero = 8 
#  
#  The user needs to download CAMS data for 11 aerosols aermr01,...,aermr11 i.e. from MARS database
#  The data should be downloaded to one netCDF file that contain all aerosols and timesteps together.
#  This file should be named  $CAMSdir/CAMS_aero_${dathh}.nc where $CAMSdir is the location
#  of the CAMS files and $dathh is the date and hour of the initial forecast time.
#
#  The 3D pressure data of the CAMS forecast is also needed. Unfortunately, this data is not explicitly available in the model output
#  and needs to be calculated. Therefore the 2D data of the natural logarithm of surface pressure - lnsp needs to 
#  be downloaded also. This time the grib format is needed and also separated file for each timestep 
#  $CAMSdir/CAMS_lnsp_${dathh}_${n}.grb where "n" is the forecast hour (3 hours resolution).
#  The 3D pressure is calculated by compute_pressure_on_ml.py which is based on compute_geopotential_on_ml.py given in: 
#  https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+compute+pressure+and+geopotential+on+model+levels%2C+geopotential+height+and+geometric+height   
#
#  CDO, python3 and ecmwf-toolbox is needed for this script to work
