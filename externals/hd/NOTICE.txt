The source code of the Hydrological Discharge model includes also some 
infrastructure routines that originate (year 2014) from MPI-ESM, the Earth System Model of the 
Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (Mauritsen et al. 2019). These routines are available 
under the BSD-3-Clause license.

  version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) and its response to increasing CO2. J. Adv. Model. Earth Syst., 11, 
  doi: 10.1029/2018MS001400.

Note that these infrastructure routines originally fell under the license of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology
(./LICENSES/mpim_licence.txt). However, in December 2023, this was changed to the BSD-3-Clause license for all those infrastructure routines. 

In addition, a few routines written by Moritz Hanke (DKRZ) that are related to the coupling of the HD model via YAC are also associated with the BSD-3-Clause license.

Further, the HD model repository comprises a few readme files (e.g. in ./docu) that are associated with the CC-BY-4.0 license. 

Finally, running the HD model requires parameter fields that are not part of this code repository. However, they are published on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/5707703) under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. This published dataset comprises parameter fields at 0.5Â° global resolution and at 5 Min. resolution (global, Europe).
