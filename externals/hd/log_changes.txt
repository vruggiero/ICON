HD model development steps
==========================
REF version mit Ha's adapted offline version from Otto

55000 Run with 1989 SL scheme input at 0.5 deg (for technical testing)
      - replacing compiler directive with namelist parameter nremap
        yields bit identical results.
      Queue: express, 15 Min.
55001 Using input from 55000 remapped to T106 and VG's remapping.
55002 Using input from 55000 remapped to T63 and VG's remapping.
   --> The HD model reads the input data dimensions from masks.nc (or rmp_hd.nc)
55003 Using HD-Model at 5 Min. and input from 55000. daily time step, 
      hdstart file simply interpolated with remapcon --> too large as storage volume
      should be divided by 36.

55005 as 55004, but routing via index arrays
      Queue: express, 5 Min.

----- Regional Europe domain defined for [-11 W; 69 E[ & ]27 N ; 72 N] 
      Interolation to this domain from global 5 Min. domain with command
      cdo selindexbox,2029,2988,217,756 ..

55011 as 55010. Results for Elbe are almost identical. They sometimes differ in the 
      4th digit after the ., i.e. precision is 10^-8 
      Queue: express, 15 Min.

55018 as 55016, Baseflow k *2   --> some improvements in correlation and RMSE
                but this may be related to the large Tot. runoff bias in Elbe and Oder.

GENERAL REMARKS
===============
Different to the coupled version in JSBACH, there is no separate calculation of P-E over lakes or P-E over glaciers.
Here, it is simply assumed that such components are already part of the forcing field of surface runoff.
Otherwise, more forcing fields would be necessary.

cdo diff auf highres-discharge nc output and the zip_2-compressed output reveals no difference.


- Coupling with ECHAM in MPI-ESM:
Freshwater that appears outside the ocean mask is distributed globally on the ocean. Hence, 
if discharge appears on an HD ocean box that is not part of the MPIOM, the water should not 
reach the ocean anywhere. (Thus, global water balance in coupling is not closed, but this may
be desired for paleo applications.)
