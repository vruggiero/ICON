		 MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGY
			   HAMBURG, GERMANY

	  SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT (Version2, 2012-02-21)

Preamble 

Since its inception, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M)
has sought to understand Earth's climate system, using as its
principal tool comprehensive Earth system modelling. The MPI-M is
committed to developing a comprehensive Earth System Model (MPI-ESM)
in which the physical aspects of the climate system are coupled with
biogeochemical cycles, and to making the MPI-ESM available to the
scientific community.

The models/components developed at the MPI-M, including components
provided by scientists of other institutes, are made available and
shared within the scientific community.

However, the MPI-M Software developed must remain controllable and
documented.  This is the spirit behind the following licence
agreement, which the MPI-M must ask the users to accept before a user
can get the MPI-M Software. It is also important to provide feedback
to the model developers, to report about errors and to suggest
improvements of the code.

MPI-M must also ensure that the MPI-M Software is protected from
misuse and false statements about its characteristics and
performance. Therefore, all alterations to the Software have to be
marked clearly and publications of results obtained with modified
versions must contain a description of the changes made.

This licence agreement is crafted as a personal licence, even though
the MPI-M knows that typically several users in one institution share
such software and develop it further in a group effort. The personal
licence ensures that each user has seen and accepted the terms of this
agreement, and it also allows the MPI-M to maintain a user data base,
which ensures efficient communication of updates and revised versions
of this software.

Points of Agreement 

1. Licence 

This is a licence to use the above-mentioned MPI-M Software (in the
following the "Software"). The "Software", which is received with and
accompanied by this licence agreement, is licenced (not sold) to you
on a personal nonexclusive basis by the MPI-M. You have to ensure that
your employer has accepted the terms of this agreement.

2. Definition of Software 

The term "Software" includes all source codes, executable programs,
documentation, run scripts and data files of MPI-M Software.

3. Permitted Use 

Use of the "Software" is permitted only for lawful scientific purposes
in research and education. It is explicitly prohibited to use this
"Software" or parts of it, whether modified or not, for commercial
purposes. For commercial use please refer to Garching Innovation GmbH
(GI), Technology Transfer for the Max Planck Society for the
Advancement of Science, Germany.

4. Copyright and Distribution 

"Software" developed at MPI-M is the sole and exclusive property of
MPI-M. All Rights Reserved.

You are allowed to make personal copies of the "Software" and to
modify the code, data files, and run scripts, and to recompile the
code on any computer system, where you have legal access.

If you make copies of the "Software", each copy must include all
copyright information and notes that accompany the original. Such
notes shall be displayed on any documents, media, printouts, and
visualization or on any other electronic or tangible expressions
associated with, related to or derived from the "Software" or
associated documentation.

You are not allowed to sell this "Software" or any part of it.

You are not allowed to distribute the "Software" in its original or
modified form.  Third party users must obtain the "Software" directly
from MPI-M. Exception: You are given the right to share the "Software"
with colleagues from your institution, provided that these colleagues
read and accept this licence agreement also.

Under the definition of permitted use you may distribute your
modifications to the "Software" provided that you adhere to the rules
concerning modifications as outlined below.

You are not allowed to sell modifications to this "Software", but you
may ask for reimbursement of the re-distribution cost.

5. Modifications 

Modifications are supplements to the "Software", which other users can
apply to the original "Software" from MPI-M. Modifications may include
revised versions of subroutines or modules, but must not constitute a
working model on their own.

You may change any part of the source code, run scripts, or data
files, provided that all files that are modified carry a prominent
notice indicating the name of the person who changed the file, the
modification date, and the purpose of the modification.  Results (data
files and plots or visualization products) obtained with modified
versions of the "Software" must bear a clearly visible label, which
distinguishes such product from any product obtained with the original
version of the "Software", unless you have ensured that the results
are in fact identical.

Error fixes and "Software" modifications must be communicated to the
coordinator of MPI-M model development/ model integration so that they
can be used to improve the "Software". This does not affect your right
to distribute such modifications as outlined above. You agree to
submit modified parts of the "Software" to MPI-M. This covers all
modifications, which maintain the functionality of the "Software" as
provided, and those modifications, which improve the model results
and/or performance.

If you develop independent new components of the models, you may cover
them with your own licence agreement as long as the terms of this
licence are not violated. In particular, you must make your code
available free of charge, and you must grant equal access rights to
MPI-M.

6. Acknowledgements 

When you publish results generated with this "Software", you agree to
refer to appropriate publications according to the appendix of this
licence agreement. The "Software" must be explicitly mentioned, and
modifications must be clearly described as outlined above. Depending
on the degree of involvement of MPI-M scientists in the publication,
their help must be acknowledged or co-authorship shall be offered.
Individual extensions of the "Software" may carry more explicit
requirements. The title and authors of any publication with results
from the "Software" shall be sent to the coordinator of MPI-M model
development/model integration not later than the publication is
submitted to a scientific journal or as a book chapter, conference
proceedings, etc. The coordinator of MPI-M model development/model
integration also appreciates receiving a preprint and a reprint of
your articles.

7. Termination 

Your rights under this licence agreement will terminate automatically
without notice from MPI-M if you fail to comply with any term(s) of
this licence. You may terminate this licence at any time by destroying
the "Software" and any related documentation and any complete or
partial copies thereof. Upon termination, all rights granted under
this licence shall terminate. Provisions of this licence that, by
their nature, contemplate continued effect after termination, shall
survive termination, including paragraphs 9 to 11.

8. Fees 

There is no licence fee for the "Software".

9. Proprietary Rights 

Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the
"Software" shall remain in MPI-M. You acknowledge such ownership and
intellectual property rights and will not take any action to
jeopardize, limit or interfere in any manner with MPI-M's ownership of
rights with respect to the "Software". The "Software" is protected by
Property Rights.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty 

You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the "Software" is at
your own risk.  The "Software" is provided "AS IS" and without
warranty of any kind. MPI-M expressly disclaims all warranties and/or
conditions, expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties and/or conditions of merchantability or
satisfactory quality and fitness for a particular purpose. MPI-M does
not warrant that the functions contained in the "Software" will meet
your requirements, or that the operation of the "Software" will be
uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects in the "Software" will be
corrected. Furthermore, MPI-M does not warrant or make any
representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the
"Software" or related documentation in terms of their correctness,
accuracy, reliability. No oral or written information or advice given
by MPI-M or an MPI-M authorized representative shall create a warranty
or in any way increase the scope of this warranty. Should the
"Software" prove defective by your use, you (and not MPI-M or any
MPI-M representative) assume the cost of all necessary correction.

11. Limitation of Liability 

Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall MPI-M be liable
for any incidental, special, indirect or consequential damages arising
out of or relating to this licence. In particular, MPI-M notes that
the "Software" is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured
or intended for use as on-line control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems,
air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems,
in which the failure of the "Software" could lead directly to death,
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High
Risk Activities"). Accordingly, MPI-M specifically disclaims any
expressed or implied warranties of fitness for High Risk
Activities. By this licence the user agrees that MPI-M shall not be
liable for any claims or damages arising from the use of the
"Software" in such applications.

12. Support/Modifications 

The "Software" is provided without any support or maintenance, and
without any obligation to provide you with modifications,
improvements, enhancements, or updates of the "Software".

Germany and the court of jurisdiction is Hamburg. If for any reason a
court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion
thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this licence shall
continue in full force and effect.

Final Remarks 

This licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the use of the "Software" and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter.
