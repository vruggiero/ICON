This test checks that the Fortran run-time is configured correctly.

Unfortunately, the following cases are known where this might not be
the case:

1. Some versions of MPICH need libxml2 of which in turn there are
   older versions which raise arithmetic exceptions due to divisions
   by zero (which is UB) being executed in xmlXPathInit.
   This then causes issues with builds that have floating point
   run-time checks enabled, like the ifort -fpe0 option.

2. In some installations, -Wl,-commons,use_dylibs is erroneously
   deactivated but required for properly functioning Fortran
   references to symbols like MPI_IN_PLACE.
