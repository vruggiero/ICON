WARNING: your MPI installation suffers from a known defect where some
data layouts are incorrectly captured by MPI datatypes because an
optimization step handles offsets incorrectly (the resulting address
is off by extent of element datatype).

This issue has been fixed in revision 28319 of OpenMPI.
