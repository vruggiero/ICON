This program demonstrates a bug that may occur when using MPI datatype hindexed.
The following MPI implementations exhibit this bug:
 * mpich/3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2 and 3.4.3

The bug results from an invalid contiguity check in the underlying
YAKSA data type library. It can be deactivated by building mpich with
option --with-datatype-engine=dataloop.

The bug is tracked at

<https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/issues/5391>

and a fix was integrated for MPICH 4.0.
