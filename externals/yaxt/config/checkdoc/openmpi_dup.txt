WARNING: your MPI installation suffers from a known defect in some
OpenMPI versions.

The problem can be tracked down to an interaction of
MPI_Type_create_struct with a previous MPI_Type_dup. When MPI_Type_dup
on line 67 of the example is replaced with a straight assignment of
MPI_INT to sends[0], the problem goes away.

The exact scope of affected version is not fully known but supposed
to be fixed in 1.6.5[1].
