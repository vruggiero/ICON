dnl First determines mpi launcher program (and sets MPI_LAUNCH to its path),
dnl then builds and runs simple program with 4 tasks
dnl (or NUM_TASKS if specified).
dnl MPI_LAUNCH is either set to a valid MPI launcher program path (unless
dnl cross-compiling, because it can't be tested then) or true (when it
dnl doesn't work).
