Your system fails a test that tries a composite type for RMA with
MPI_Win_lock and MPI_Get. This is known to be an issue for early
(1.6.x) versions of OpenMPI. On systems with homogeneous cluster nodes,
i.e. all machines have the same type of CPU, this problem can be
worked around by setting the environment variable

PPM_DIST_MULT_ARRAY_TRANSFER_MODE=bytes
