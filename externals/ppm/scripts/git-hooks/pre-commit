# Hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by git-commit with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.

# To enable this hook, link it into the .git/hooks directory:
#  ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

# This is slightly modified from Andrew Morton's Perfect Patch.
# Lines you introduce should not have trailing whitespace.
# Also check for an indentation that has SP before a TAB.
