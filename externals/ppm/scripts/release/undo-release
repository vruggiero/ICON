# undo-release -- after a test of the release process or an
#                 incorrectly performed release, undo the changes
#                 incurred by the associated script actions from
#                 release-as
#
# This script only acts on the local repository copy and does not
# attempt to remove tags/release branches published to other
# repository copies.
