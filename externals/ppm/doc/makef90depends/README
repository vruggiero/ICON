As promised over 1 year ago[2] I've now made our dependency tracker completely independent from autoconf. It's available[3] from the site of the library it was originally developed in[1].

To quote from the original post:

For a simple experiment run it like:

perl -Iscripts scripts/makef90depends -- -- src/*.f90

if your sources are in files in subdirectory src. Feedback is very
much appreciated.  To get everything right for compilers varying from
typical Linux x86_64 compilers, a number of options needs to be
set.

To parse preprocessor conditionals correctly, environment variables FC
and FPP should be set to appropriate commands. Compilers that need
help with that[4] because they can't write preprocessed input to
stdout need one of the provided wrappers.

Generally options that change the behaviour of the tracker go before
the first double dash and options to the compiler (in our case
$(AM_FCFLAGS) $(FCFLAGS)) go before the second double dash so that the
tracker knows how to correctly invoke the compiler and can see
include/module directories for itself.

The distribution[5] contains a very detailed setup, but understanding
probably requires reading fluency of autoconf/automake.

The manual page can be generated with pod2man. To read it immediately
try somethng like:

$ pod2man config/makef90depends |man -l -

on a Unix system. The script is untested on Windows but should be easy
to get to work there also.
