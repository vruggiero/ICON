Languages

Currently all library source is in Fortran 95 or C99.

Identifiers which are globally visible via their linker symbol should
start with a prefix of "PPM_" or "ppm_".

For Fortran, this means all symbols should preferrably be part of a
module whose name starts with ppm_ and shall have a name starting with
ppm_ otherwise[1].

For C, all public identifiers shall be mixed case with upper case
"PPM_" at the start.

Licenses

The library is composed of sources under BSD license and files available
under a compatible license.

Since every file must contain a license statement, it's preferred to use
scripts/checklicense prior to committing.

With git this can be ensured by:

$ echo "REPOTOP="$(git-rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
"${REPOTOP}/scripts/checklicense" >>.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample
$ mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

[1] Since Fortran name mangling cannot be controlled, the lower case
    prefix is used.
