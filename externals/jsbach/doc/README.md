# Documentation for ICON-LES/JSBACH4

Documentation is auto-generated using [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford/wiki){:target="_blank"} from

- comments in the source code
- markdown files in directory `./guide`

To generate the documentation, install FORD and run

    ./build-doc.sh [-q] [-f]

    with optionally

      -q: quiet (do not print progress)
      -f: fast (skip the search feature to save time)

Then open `./doc/html/index.html` in your browser.

**Note:** `doc/html` is included in .gitignore so the generated html will not be committed.
{: .note}

The documentation is also generated by gitlib-ci (gitlab continuous integration) and is
available at [gitlab-pages](https://jsbach.gitlab-pages.dkrz.de/jsbach){:target="_blank"} .

**Note:** This could be done automatically on each git commit ... currently, it is done manually.
