## Generated files in the `utils` subdirectory

This subdirectory contains a number of generator scripts for generating linked lists and accessor functions.

Each preprocessor job follows the syntax
```bash
python3 <sourcefile.py> > <destinationfile>
```
A `Makefile` has been provided to run the preprocessor.
