Since CDI version 2.0.0 access to FDB5 is supported.
This support has the status experimental, because the error handling is still very limited.
Furthermore, the user interface currently allows only limited access to the FDB.
For FDB access a fdb5 and ecCodes library is required.
FDB5 support is enabled with the configure option:

     --with-fdb5=<fdb5 root directory>
