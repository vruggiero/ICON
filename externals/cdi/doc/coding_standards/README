All CDI C files (.h/.c) should obey the formatting shown in
ref-example.c:

* Only use spaces for indentation, i.e. no tabs.
* Indent by 2 spaces per level.
* Indent the braces of blocks following an operator such as for,if,while.
  (but not those following the function signature).
* Opening and closing braces should be placed on a line of their own.

To ensure the corresponding settings are automatically in place, in case
you are using

* Emacs: use the appended local variables or set your Emacs environment
  accordingly.

* vi: ?
