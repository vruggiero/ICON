This toy can be used to measure performance. The setup can be launched with
an arbitrary number of processes for each component. The two components are:

  a) perf_toy_cube.c
  b) perf_toy_icon.c

The script perf_toy.sh contains an example launch configuration. The coupling
configuration can be found in perf_toy.yaml.
