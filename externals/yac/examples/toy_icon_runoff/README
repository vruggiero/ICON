In order to easily check the source to target mapping, especially required
to map the hydrological discharge from the atmosphere to the ocean, a pair
of toys is provided

  a) toy_icon_runoff_atm.c
  b) toy_icon_runoff_ocn.c

The coupling configuration is described in toy_icon_runoff.yaml.
The components read in ICON grids and send data from atm to ocn.

mpirun -np 1 toy_icon_runoff_atm.x : -np 2 toy_icon_runoff_ocn.x
