A set of dummy components are used to test the c user interface
and the coupling between three components. The grids are defined
internally and are kept simple.

a) dummy_atmosphere_c.c
b) dummy_ocean_c.c
c) dummy_io_c.c

A similar set of components is provided in Fortran first to check the
functionality of the Fortran user interface and second to provide an
example about the usage of the YAC Fortran interface.

a) dummy_atmosphere.F90
b) dummy_ocean.F90
c) dummy_io.F90

toy_dummy.yaml is used for both, the Fortran and the c dummies.

To start the coupled setup use

    mpirun -np 1 dummy_atmosphere_c.x : np 1 dummy_ocean_c.x : -np 1 dummy_io_c.x

and likewise for the Fortran dummies

    mpirun -np 1 dummy_atmosphere.x : np 1 dummy_ocean.x : -np 1 dummy_io.x

Skipping the io component does also work:

    mpirun -np 1 dummy_atmosphere_c.x : np 1 dummy_ocean_c.x
    mpirun -np 1 dummy_atmosphere.x : np 1 dummy_ocean.x
