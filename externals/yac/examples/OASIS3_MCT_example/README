OASIS3_MCT_example.c

This toy reproduces a complex coupling setup which was introduced by the
following paper:
  Development and performance of a new version of the OASIS coupler,
  OASIS3-MCT_3.0 (http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2017-64/)
It demonstrates most supported coupling configuration (e.g. two components
on same processes, two components only some instances sharing processes,
processes with inactive components,...)

The following script contains the run configuration for this example:
  OASIS3_MCT_example.sh
