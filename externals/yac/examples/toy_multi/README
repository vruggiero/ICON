a) toy_multi_cube.c

  component on a cubed sphere grid

b) toy_multi_reg2d.c

  component on a regular longitude-latitude grid

c) toy_multi_unstruct.c

  component reading in a ICON grid

d) toy_multi_unstruct_2.c

  component reading in a MPIOM grid

A mpmd run with any combination of these toy can be run (e.g. only two
components or all). Each component can be run with an arbitrary number of
processes, as long as enough cells per process is available.

The coupling configuration for this example is in toy_multi.yaml. It
contains for all two component pairs multiple different interpolations in both
directions each.

The runscript toy_multi.sh contains an example run configuration.

Each process writes out a vtk file containing the interpolation results. The
output fields of the components are all based on a analytic function.
