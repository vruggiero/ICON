<p>\"A complete rewrite of legacy science software, with a specific
focus on clarity, can prove useful. It uncovers bugs, provide a
definitive statement of the underlying algorithm, lets scientists
easily pose and answer new research questions, makes it easier to
develop new visualizations and other interfaces, and makes the code
considerably more accessible to interested third parties and the
public.\"</p>

Science Software for Clarity. IEEE Software, Nov/Dec 2011, 36 - 42.]</p>

<p>The YAC development started as a pilot study to investigate the
coupling between unstructured meshes which gradually turned into a mature
fully parallelised coupling software. Rather than implementing all
required functionality directly into an existing coupler like OASIS4
we decided to ground our effort on a light weight software
infrastructure. YAC2 is a redesign of YAC1. All interpolation methods
available in YAC1 are supported with YAC2. In contrast to YAC1 halo
information is no longr required. In order to keep the software light
we still stick to:</p>

<dl>
        <dt />
        <dd>
        Only unstructured and fully regular grids are supported directly.<br />
        Internally, grid information and exchange fields are handled as double.<br />
        Fortran reals are converted to double precision before delivering it to the C world.<br />
