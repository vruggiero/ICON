I.) Building YAC
----------------

Examples on how to configure and build yac are provided on

https://dkrz-sw.gitlab-pages.dkrz.de/yac/

See "Related Pages",
    - "Configuration examples for different systems"


1.) autoreconf
2.) configure ...
3.) make

Remarks:
  * The weight generated by YAC should be decomposition independent. However,
    compiler optimsations can lead to minimal differences. For Intel this can
    be avoided by compiling with "-fp-model precise".


II.) Testing YAC
----------------

"make check" will run the test suite.


III.) Examples
--------------

See the README in the examples directory learn how to
use the Fortran and C user interface. We also provide
examples to test the coupling between realistic grids.
These examples can also be used to study the behaviour
of the various interpolations and the interpolation
stack.
